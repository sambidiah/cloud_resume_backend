def test_visitor_counter_system():
    """
    System test for the Visitor Counter API.

    This test performs the following actions:
    1. Makes a GET request to the visitor counter API to retrieve the initial visitor count.
    2. Validates that the response status code is 200 (OK).
    3. Ensures that the response body contains a valid integer representing the visitor count.
    4. Verifies that the response includes the correct CORS header (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` set to '*').
    5. Makes a second GET request to increment the visitor count.
    6. Validates that the status code of the second response is also 200.
    7. Ensures that the visitor count has incremented by 1 compared to the initial value.
    8. Prints the initial and updated visitor count for debugging purposes.

    Assertions:
    - The API responds with a status code of 200 on both requests.
    - The visitor count is a valid integer.
    - The CORS header is correctly set to allow cross-origin requests.
    - The visitor count increments by exactly 1 after the second request.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If the visitor count in the response cannot be converted to an integer.
    - AssertionError: If the status code is not 200, the CORS header is missing/incorrect, or the visitor count does not increment by 1 as expected.
